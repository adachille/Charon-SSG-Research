# Charon-SSG-Research
This is a repository for Charon SSG research. It holds any code and resources needed to create our research publications.

# Odd Lot
The odd lot folder holds code that webscrapes the Edgar web service and looks for every tender offer listed that has an odd lot clause. It then creates a csv with the date of the tender offer filing, the cik of the company, and the url to a page of the tender offer files. The code allows us to do an analysis on tender offers with odd lot clauses.
